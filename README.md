Based on the Bocoup Code of Conduct https://bocoup.com/guidelines/code-of-conduct

By attending a Run Sprints conference, meetup, or any other event, in any capacity, including as a delegate, speaker, sponsor, volunteer, or guest, you agree to abide by this code of conduct, and cooperate with the event organizers who enforce it.

The Quick Version

Run Sprints is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the event organizers.

The Less Quick Version

Purpose

This document exists to empower participants at Run Sprints events to create an atmosphere that is professional, empathetic, and conducive to learning.

Expected Participant Behaviour

Participants are expected to behave appropriately and professionally during their participation in all events. In particular, all participants should actively avoid intentionally or unintentionally participating in the harassment of other attendees. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Sponsors are subject to the same expectations as event guests, and are both considered “participants”. In addition, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If another participant or staff member at the event asks you to stop engaging in some behavior, you should comply immediately, and are encouraged to contact a conference organizer for further guidance.

Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Event organizers enforcing this document may, at their discretion, ask a participant to stop some behavior, warn the participant of their violation, or expel the participant from the event with no refund (including no return of sponsorship contributions). Participants are expected to comply immediately with such requests from the organizers.

If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff immediately.

Event staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

Open Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

Photography Policy

At our events and conferences, we encourage attendees to take and share their own photographs. We also engage photographers as staff members to document our events in an official capacity. Anyone taking photos is expected to follow the general Code of Conduct, as well as abide by the guidelines in this policy.

Photography should be treated like other potentially harassing interpersonal interaction. That is, when one person in the interaction says “stop” or “leave me alone” (etc), the interaction must end. In this case, attendees should not attempt to photograph that individual again. Photographers should use judgment and be considerate of the people in their photographs, especially if photographing individuals with whom they are not personally acquainted.

Because it can be difficult for photographers to know everything they’ve captured in a given shot until after the photo is taken, the rest of this policy pertains exclusively to the publication of photography and not the capture of it. Publication includes both marketing media like websites and print collateral, as well posting to social media like Twitter, Instagram, Flickr, or Facebook.

The Main Rule

Anyone can ask that a photo of themselves be unpublished or that they be removed from the photo at any time for any reason. Refusing to do so is a breach of the Code of Conduct and will result in you being expelled from the event and banned from future events.

Scope

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and related social events.
